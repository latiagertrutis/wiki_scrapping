{"Oil":[["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker",["[1] Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries.","[1] For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States."," The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight (DWT) to the mammoth ultra large crude carriers (ULCCs) of 550,000  DWT."," Tankers move approximately 2,000,000,000 metric tons (2  109 short tons) of oil every year.","[2][3] Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency,[3] the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only two or three United States cents per 1 US gallon (3.","8  L).","[3] Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved."," Although human use of oil reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850.","[5] In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony.","[6] In the 1860s, Pennsylvania oil fields became a major supplier of oil, and a center of innovation after Edwin Drake had struck oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania.","[7] Break-bulk boats and barges were originally used to transport Pennsylvania oil in 40-US-gallon (150  l) wooden barrels.","[7] But transport by barrel had several problems."," The first problem was weight: they weighed 64 pounds (29  kg), representing 20% of the total weight of a full barrel.","[8] Other problems with barrels were their expense, their tendency to leak, and the fact that they were generally used only once.","[8] In 1863, two sail-driven tankers were built on England's River Tyne.","[9] These were followed in 1873 by the first oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners.","[9][5] The vessel's use was curtailed by U.","[6] By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars similar to those in use today.","[7] The modern oil tanker was developed in the period from 1877 to 1885.","[10] In 1876, Ludvig and Robert Nobel, brothers of Alfred Nobel, founded Branobel (short for Brothers Nobel) in Baku, Azerbaijan."," It was, during the late 19th century, one of the largest oil companies in the world.","[8] Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, he faced a number of challenges.","[11] Other challenges included allowing for the cargo to expand and contract due to temperature changes, and providing a method to ventilate the tanks.","[11] The first successful oil tanker was Zoroaster, which carried its 242 long tons of kerosene cargo in two iron tanks joined by pipes.","[11] One tank was forward of the midships engine room and the other was aft.","[11] The ship also featured a set of 21 vertical watertight compartments for extra buoyancy.","[11] The ship had a length overall of 184 feet (56  m), a beam of 27 feet (8.","2  m), and a draft of 9 feet (2.","7  m).","[11] Unlike later Nobel tankers, the Zoroaster design was built small enough to sail from Sweden to the Caspian by way of the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, the Rybinsk and Mariinsk Canals and the Volga River.","[11] In 1883, oil tanker design took a large step forward.","[12] Instead of one or two large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship.","[12] These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead.","[12] Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize.","[13] But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems.","[13] This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.","[12][14] Others point to Gl  ckauf, another design of Colonel Swan, as being the first modern oil tanker.","[15][16]  It was also the first tanker with a horizontal bulkhead;[17][page  needed] its features included cargo valves operable from the deck, cargo main piping, a vapor line, cofferdams for added safety, and the ability to fill a ballast tank with seawater when empty of cargo.","[18] The ship was built in Britain.","[19] and was purchased by Wilhelm Anton Riedemann, an agent for the Standard Oil Company along with several of her sister ships.","[18] After Gl  ckauf was lost in 1893 after being grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the sister ships.","[18] The 1880s also saw the beginnings of the Asian oil trade.","[18] The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane.","[18] Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company as being too risky.","[18] Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.","[18] Armed with the canal company's specifications, Samuel ordered three tankers from William Gray & Company in northern England.","[18] Named Murex, Conch and Clam, each had a capacity of 5,010  long tons of deadweight.","[18] These three ships were the first tankers of the Tank Syndicate, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.","[18] With facilities prepared in Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, the fledgling Shell company was ready to become Standard Oil's first challenger in the Asian market.","[18] On August 24, 1892, Murex became the first tanker to pass through the Suez Canal.","[18] By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers, compared to Standard Oil's four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing tankers.","[18] Until 1956, tankers were designed to be able to navigate the Suez Canal.","[20] This size restriction became much less of a priority after the closing of the canal during the Suez Crisis of 1956.","[20] Forced to move oil around the Cape of Good Hope, shipowners realized that bigger tankers were the key to more efficient transport.","[20][21] While a typical T2 tanker of the World War II era was 532 feet (162  m) long and had a capacity of 16,500  DWT, the ultra-large crude carriers (ULCC) built in the 1970s were over 1,300 feet (400  m) long and had a capacity of 500,000  DWT.","[22] Several factors encouraged this growth.","[21] Fierce competition among shipowners also played a part.","[21] But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: the larger an oil tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and the better it can help meet growing demands for oil.","[21] In 1955 the world's largest supertanker was 30,708  GRT[23] and 47,500  LT  DWT:[24] SS Spyros Niarchos launched that year by Vickers Armstrongs Shipbuilders Ltd in England for Stavros Niarchos."," In 1958 United States shipping magnate Daniel K."," Ludwig broke the record of 100,000 long tons of heavy displacement.","[25] His Universe Apollo displaced 104,500 long tons, a 23% increase from the previous record-holder, Universe Leader which also belonged to Ludwig.","[25][26] The world's largest supertanker was built in 1979 at the Oppama shipyard by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd."," This ship was built with a capacity of 564,763  DWT, a length overall of 458.","45 metres (1,504.","1  ft) and a draft of 24.","611 metres (80.","74  ft).","[27] She had 46 tanks, 31,541 square metres (339,500  sq  ft) of deck, and at her full load draft, could not navigate the English Channel.","[28] Seawise Giant was renamed Happy Giant in 1989, Jahre Viking in 1991,[27] and Knock Nevis in 2004 (when she was converted into a permanently moored storage tanker).","[28][29] In 2009 she was sold for the last time, renamed Mont, and scrapped.","[30] As of 2011, the world's two largest working supertankers are the TI-class supertankers TI Europe and TI Oceania.","[31][32] These ships were built in 2002 and 2003 as Hellespont Alhambra and Hellespont Tara for the Greek Hellespont Steamship Corporation.","[33] Hellespont sold these ships to Overseas Shipholding Group and Euronav in 2004.","[34] Each of the sister ships has a capacity of over 441,500  DWT, a length overall of 380.","0 metres (1,246.","7  ft) and a cargo capacity of 3,166,353 barrels (503,409,900  l).","[35] They were the first ULCCs to be double-hulled.","[33]  To differentiate them from smaller ULCCs, these ships are sometimes given the V-Plus size designation.","[35][36] With the exception of the pipeline, the tanker is the most cost-effective way to move oil today.","[37] Worldwide, tankers carry some 2 billion barrels (3.","2  1011  l) annually, and the cost of transportation by tanker amounts to only US$0.","02 per gallon at the pump.","[37] In 1954 Shell Oil developed the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) system which classifies tankers of different sizes."," At first, they divided the groups as General Purpose for tankers under 25,000  tons deadweight (DWT); Medium Range for ships between 25,000 and 45,000  DWT and Large Range for the then-enormous ships that were larger than 45,000  DWT."," The ships became larger during the 1970s, which prompted rescaling.","[38] The system was developed for tax reasons as the tax authorities wanted evidence that the internal billing records were correct."," Before the New York Mercantile Exchange started trading crude oil futures in 1983, it was difficult to determine the exact price of oil, which could change with every contract."," Shell and BP, the first companies to use the system, abandoned the AFRA system in 1983, later followed by the US oil companies."," Besides that, there is the flexible market scale, which takes typical routes and lots of 500,000 barrels (79,000  m3).","[41] Merchant oil tankers carry a wide range of hydrocarbon liquids ranging from crude oil to refined petroleum products.","[1] Their size is measured in deadweight metric tons (DWT)."," Crude carriers are among the largest, ranging from 55,000  DWT Panamax-sized vessels to ultra-large crude carriers (ULCCs) of over 440,000  DWT.","[42] Smaller tankers, ranging from well under 10,000  DWT to 80,000  DWT Panamax vessels, generally carry refined petroleum products, and are known as product tankers.","[42] The smallest tankers, with capacities under 10,000  DWT generally work near-coastal and inland waterways.","[42] Although they were in the past, ships of the smaller Aframax and Suezmax classes are no longer regarded as supertankers.","[43] \"Supertankers\" are the largest tankers, and the largest man-made mobile structures."," They include very large crude carriers (VLCC) and ULCCs with capacities over 250,000  DWT."," These ships can transport 2,000,000 barrels (320,000  m3) of oil/318,000 metric tons.","[42] By way of comparison, the United Kingdom consumed about 1.","6 million barrels (250,000  m3) of oil per day in 2009.","[44] ULCCs, commissioned in the 1970s, were the largest vessels ever built, but the longest ones have already been scrapped."," By 2013 only a few ULCCs remain in service, none of which are more than 400 meters long.","[45] Because of their great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded.","[21] These ships can take on their cargo at off-shore platforms and single-point moorings.","[21] On the other end of the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast.","[21] Supertanker routes are typically long, requiring them to stay at sea for extended periods, often around seventy days at a time.","[21] The act of hiring a ship to carry cargo is called chartering.","[46] In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port.","[46] In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs.","[46] In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel.","[47] Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as 1 million barrels (160,000  m3) of JP-5 in a year's time in 25,000-barrel (4,000  m3) shipments.","[48] A completed chartering contract is known as a charter party.","[48] One of the key aspects of any charter party is the freight rate, or the price specified for carriage of cargo.","[49]  The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate.","[49] In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible to pay for all port costs and other voyage expenses.","[50]  Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer.","[51] Time charter arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.","[51] The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often referred to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York.","[49] Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world.","[52] In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate.","[52] The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100.","[52] If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would be expressed as WS 85.","[52] Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would be expressed as WS 125.","[52] As of  2007[update], the chartering market is persistently volatile across all tanker sectors.","[54] The market is affected by a wide variety of variables such as the supply and demand of oil as well as the supply and demand of oil tankers.","[54] In 2006, the sustained rise in oil prices had only a limited impact on demand.","[57] It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but not as good as 2004 and 2005.","[57] Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year.","[57] As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand.","[57] Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006.","[57] Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.","[56] In 2006, time-charters tended towards long term.","  Of the time charters executed in that year, 58% were for a period of 24 or more months, 14% were for periods of 12 to 24 months, 4% were from 6 to 12 months, and 24% were for periods of less than 6 months.","[56] The average one-year time charter rate for a 5-year-old tanker of 280,000 metric tons of deadweight varied from $56,500 per day in December 2005 to $53,000 per day in September 2007 with a high of $64,500 per day in September 2006.","[56] The first half of 2007 was relatively strong, but in the second half rates dropped significantly.","  Overnight, VLCC rates climbed from $20,000 per day to $200   $300,000 per day, and even higher numbers were recorded.","[58] From 2003, the demand for new ships started to grow, resulting in 2007 in a record breaking order backlog for shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result.","[59] This resulted in a glut of ships when demand dropped due to a weakened global economy and dramatically reduced demand in the United States."," The charter rate for very large crude carriers, which carry two million barrels of oil, had peaked at $309,601 per day in 2007, and has dropped, as of 2012, to $7,085 per day, far below the operating costs of these ships.","[60]  As a result, several tanker operators laid up their ships."," Prices rose significantly in 2015 and early 2016, but delivery of new tankers was projected to keep prices in check.","[53] Owners of large oil tanker fleets include Teekay Corporation, A P Moller Maersk, DS Torm, Frontline, MOL Tankship Management, Overseas Shipholding Group, and Euronav.","[61] In 2005, oil tankers made up 36.","9% of the world's fleet in terms of deadweight tonnage.","[62] The world's total oil tankers deadweight tonnage has increased from 326.","1 million  DWT in 1970 to 960.","0 million  DWT in 2005.","[62] The combined deadweight tonnage of oil tankers and bulk carriers, represents 72.","9% of the world's fleet.","[63] In 2005, 2.","42 billion metric tons of oil were shipped by tanker.","[2]  76.","7% of this was crude oil, and the rest consisted of refined petroleum products.","[2]  This amounted to 34.","1% of all seaborne trade for the year.","[2]  Combining the amount carried with the distance it was carried, oil tankers moved 11,705 billion metric-ton-miles of oil in 2005.","[64] By comparison, in 1970 1.","44 billion metric tons of oil were shipped by tanker.","[65]  This amounted to 34.","1% of all seaborne trade for that year.","[66]  In terms of amount carried and distance carried, oil tankers moved 6,487 billion metric-ton-miles of oil in 1970.","[64] The United Nations also keeps statistics about oil tanker productivity, stated in terms of metric tons carried per metric ton of deadweight as well as metric-ton-miles of carriage per metric ton of deadweight.","[67]  In 2005, for each 1  DWT of oil tankers, 6.","7 metric tons of cargo was carried.","[67]  Similarly, each 1  DWT of oil tankers was responsible for 32,400 metric-ton miles of carriage.","[67] The main loading ports in 2005 were located in Western Asia, Western Africa, North Africa, and the Caribbean, with 196.","3, 196.","3, 130.","2 and 246.","6 million metric tons of cargo loaded in these regions.","[68]  The main discharge ports were located in North America, Europe, and Japan with 537.","7, 438.","4, and 215.","0 million metric tons of cargo discharged in these regions.","[68] International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its flag state.","[69] A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents."," As of 2007, the United States Central Intelligence Agency statistics count 4,295  oil tankers of 1,000  long tons deadweight (DWT) or greater worldwide.","[70] Panama was the world's largest flag state for oil tankers, with 528 of the vessels in its registry.","[70] Six other flag states had more than 200 registered oil tankers: Liberia (464), Singapore (355), China (252), Russia (250), the Marshall Islands (234) and the Bahamas (209).","[70] The Panamanian, Liberian, Marshallese and Bahamian flags are open registries and considered by the International Transport Workers' Federation to be flags of convenience.","[71] By comparison, the United States and the United Kingdom only had 59 and 27 registered oil tankers, respectively.","[70] In 2005, the average age of oil tankers worldwide was 10 years.","[72] Of these, 31.","6% were under 4 years old and 14.","3% were over 20 years old.","[73] In 2005, 475 new oil tankers were built, accounting for 30.","7 million  DWT.","[74] The average size for these new tankers was 64,632  DWT.","[74] Nineteen of these were VLCC size, 19 were suezmax, 51 were aframax, and the rest were smaller designs.","[74] By comparison, 8.","0 million  DWT, 8.","7 million  DWT, and 20.","8 million  DWT worth of oil tanker capacity was built in 1980, 1990, and 2000 respectively.","[74] Ships are generally removed from the fleet through a process known as scrapping.","[75] Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market.","[76] In 1998 almost 700 ships went through the scrapping process at shipbreakers in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh.","[75] In 2004 and 2005, 7.","8 million  DWT and 5.","7 million  DWT respectively of oil tankers were scrapped.","[72] Between 2000 and 2005, the capacity of oil tankers scrapped each year has ranged between 5.","6 million  DWT and 18.","4 million  DWT.","[77] In this same timeframe, tankers have accounted for between 56.","5% and 90.","5% of the world's total scrapped ship tonnage.","[77] In this period the average age of scrapped oil tankers has ranged from 26.","9 to 31.","5 years.","[77] In 2005, the price for new oil tankers in the 32,000   45,000  DWT, 80,000   105,000  DWT, and 250,000   280,000  DWT ranges were US$43 million, $58 million, and $120 million respectively.","[78] In 1985 these vessels would have cost $18 million, $22 million, and $47 million respectively.","[78] Oil tankers are often sold second-hand."," In 2005, 27.","3 million  DWT worth of oil tankers were sold used.","[79] Some representative prices for that year include $42.","5M for a 40,000  DWT tanker, $60.","7 million for a 80,000   95,000  DWT, $73 million for a 130,000   150,000  DWT, and $116 million for 250,000   280,000  DWT tanker.","[79] For a concrete example, in 2006, Bonheur subsidiary First Olsen paid US$76.","5 million for Knock Sheen, a 159,899 DWT tanker.","[80] The cost of operating the largest tankers, the Very Large Crude Carriers, is currently between $10,000 and $12,000 per day.","[81][82] Oil tankers generally have from 8 to 12 tanks.","[14]  Each tank is split into two or three independent compartments by fore-and-aft bulkheads.","[14] The tanks are numbered with tank one being the forwardmost.","\"[14] A cofferdam is a small little space left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or collision.","[14] Tankers generally have cofferdams forward and aft of the cargo tanks, and sometimes between individual tanks.","[83] A pumpable room houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo lines.","[14]  Some larger tankers have two pumprooms.","[14] A pumproom generally spans the total breadth of the ship.","[14] A major component of tanker architecture is the design of the hull or outer structure.","[84]  Most newer tankers are \"double hulled\", with an extra space between the hull and the storage tanks.","[84] Hybrid designs such as \"double-bottom\" and \"double-sided\" combine aspects of single and double-hull designs.","[84] All single-hulled tankers around the world will be phased out by 2026, in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).","[84] The United Nations has decided to phase out single hull oil tankers by 2010.","[85] In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science conducted a survey of industry experts regarding the pros and cons of double-hull design."," Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations,[86] reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion,[87] increased environmental protection,[87] cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier,[87] tank washing is more efficient,[87] and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.","[87] The same report lists the following as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs,[88] greater operating expenses (e."," higher canal and port tariffs),[88] difficulties in ballast tank ventilation,[88] the fact that ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance,[88] increased transverse free surface,[88] the greater number of surfaces to maintain,[88] the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted,[89] and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.","[89] In all, double-hull tankers are said to be safer than a single-hull in a grounding incident, especially when the shore is not very rocky.","[90] The safety benefits are less clear on larger vessels and in cases of high speed impact.","[87] Although double-hull design is superior in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and into the sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.","[91] An oil tanker's inert gas system is one of the most important parts of its design.","[92] Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations.","[93] The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.","[92] As inert gas is introduced into a mixture of hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited.","[94] At the same time it decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited.","[94] When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.","[95] Inert gas systems deliver air with an oxygen concentration of less than 5% by volume.","[92] As a tank is pumped out, it is filled with inert gas and kept in this safe state until the next cargo is loaded.","[96]  The exception is in cases when the tank must be entered.","[96] Safely gas-freeing a tank is accomplished by purging hydrocarbon vapors with inert gas until the hydrocarbon concentration inside the tank is under about 1%.","[96] Thus, as air replaces the inert gas, the concentration cannot rise to the lower flammable limit and is safe.","[96] Operations aboard oil tankers are governed by an established body of best practices and a large body of international law.","[97] Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways.","[98] A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering.","[99] Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.","[99] Prior to any transfer of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing specifics of the operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting will change.","[100] The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference.","[101] The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.","[101] After the conference is complete, the person in charge on the ship and the person in charge of the shore installation go over a final inspection checklist.","[101] In the United States, the checklist is called a Declaration of Inspection or DOI.","[101] Outside the U.","\"[101] Items on the checklist include proper signals and signs are displayed,[101] secure mooring of the vessel,[101] choice of language for communication,[102] securing of all connections,[102] that emergency equipment is in place,[102] and that no repair work is taking place.","[102] Loading an oil tanker consists primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks.","[102] As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled.","[102] Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled into the atmosphere or discharged back to the pumping station by way of a vapor recovery line.","[102] It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.","[102] Loading starts slowly at a low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure.","[102] Then a steady pressure is achieved and held until the \"topping-off\" phase when the tanks are nearly full.","[102] Topping off is a very dangerous time in handling oil, and the procedure is handled particularly carefully.","[102] Tank-gauging equipment is used to tell the person in charge how much space is left in the tank, and all tankers have at least two independent methods for tank-gauging.","[102] As the tanker becomes full, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the pumping facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.","[102] The process of moving oil off of a tanker is similar to loading, but has some key differences.","[103] The first step in the operation is following the same pretransfer procedures as used in loading.","[104] When the transfer begins, it is the ship's cargo pumps that are used to move the product ashore.","[104] As in loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure.","[104] Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation.","[105] While pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored.","[103] Under the direction of the person in charge, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.","[103] Tanks must be cleaned from time to time for various reasons.","[106] Also, when tanks are to be inspected or maintenance must be performed within a tank, it must be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.","[106] On most crude-oil tankers, a special crude oil washing (COW) system is part of the cleaning process.","[106] The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits.","[106] Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water.","[106] Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank.","[106] As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.","[106] After a tank is cleaned, provided that it is going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged."," \"Gas freeing\" brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.","8% O2.","[107] After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking.","[108] Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.","[108] Some sub-types of oil tankers have evolved to meet specific military and economic needs.","[109] Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on fuel.","[110] In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores and personnel.","[111] An ore-bulk-oil carrier, also known as combination carrier or OBO, is a ship designed to be capable of carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes.","[112] This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways.","[113] Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions.","[113] Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.","[114] In practice, the flexibility which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend to specialize in either the liquid or dry bulk trade.","[114] Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems.","[113] On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker.","[113] On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse.","[113] These factors have contributed to a steady reduction in the number of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.","[114] One of the more famous OBOs was MV  Derbyshire of 180,000  DWT which in September 1980 became the largest British ship ever lost at sea.","[112] It sank in a Pacific typhoon while carrying a cargo of iron ore from Canada to Japan.","[112] Floating storage and offloading units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store it until it can be offloaded onto oil tankers.","[115] A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), has the ability to process the product while it is on board.","[115] These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.","[115] FPSO and FSOs are often created out of old, stripped-down oil tankers, but can be made from new-built hulls[115] Shell Espa  a first used a tanker as an FPSO in August 1977.","[116] An example of a FSO that used to be an oil tanker is the Knock Nevis.","[27] These units are usually moored to the seabed through a spread mooring system.","[115] A turret-style mooring system can be used in areas prone to severe weather.","[115]  This turret system lets the unit rotate to minimize the effects of sea-swell and wind.","[115] Oil spills have devastating effects on the environment.","[118] Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles."," As discussed above, a VLCC tanker can carry 2 million barrels (320,000  m3) of crude oil."," In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped 10,800,000 US gallons (41,000  m3) of oil into the ocean in March 1989."," Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.","[118] Considering the volume of oil carried by sea, however, tanker owners' organisations often argue that the industry's safety record is excellent, with only a tiny fraction of a percentage of oil cargoes carried ever being spilled."," The International Association of Independent Tanker Owners has observed that \"accidental oil spills this decade have been at record low levels   one third of the previous decade and one tenth of the 1970s   at a time when oil transported has more than doubled since the mid 1980s."," According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.","7% of the volume of oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.","6% from facilities and other non-vessels, 19.","9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.","3% from pipelines; 7.","4% from mystery spills.","[119] Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.","8% came from other kinds of vessels.","[119] The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume."," The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 accidental spills that have occurred since 1974.","[120] According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.","[120]  91% of the operational oil spills are small, resulting in less than 7 metric tons per spill.","[120] On the other hand, spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 metric tons.","[120] Following the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which excluded single-hull tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons or more from US waters from 2010 onward, apart from those with a double bottom or double sides, which may be permitted to trade to the United States through 2015, depending on their age.","[121] Following the sinkings of Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which also require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010.","[122] Air pollution from engine operation and from cargo fires is another serious concern.","[123]  Ship fires may result in the loss of the ship due to lack of specialized firefighting gear and techniques and fires can burn for days.",""]],["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme",[" The Oil-for-Food Programme (OIP), established by the United Nations in

citizens without allowing Iraq to boost its military capabilities."," The programme was introduced by United States President Bill Clinton's administration in 1995,[2] as a response to arguments that ordinary Iraqi citizens were inordinately affected by the international economic sanctions aimed at the demilitarisation of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, imposed in the wake of the first Gulf War."," The sanctions were discontinued on 21 November 2003 after the U.","[3] The programme was de jure terminated in 2003 and de facto terminated in 2010."," The Oil-for-Food Programme was instituted to relieve

resolution."," The Oil-for-Food Programme started in December 1996, and the first shipments of food arrived in March 1997."," Oil exported from Iraq was paid for by the recipient into an escrow account possessed until 2001 by BNP Paribas bank, rather than to the Iraqi government."," Over US $53 billion worth of Iraqi oil was sold on the world market."," About US $46 billion of this was intended to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people such as food and medicine, given the context of international economic sanctions."," A considerable portion was spent on Gulf War reparations paid through a compensation fund (25% starting December 2000)."," UN administrative and operational costs for the programme was US $1.","2 billion; the cost of the weapons inspection programme was also paid from these funds.","[6]    Testimony on A Comparative Evaluation of United Nations Peacekeeping by James Dobbins presented before the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 2007 Shortly before United States and British forces invaded Iraq, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan suspended the programme and evacuated more than 300 workers monitoring the distribution of supplies."," On 28 March 2003, Secretary-General Annan, the United States, and Britain asked the Security Council to ensure that nearly US $10 billion in goods Iraq had ordered and that were already approved   including US $2.","4 billion for food   could enter the country once conditions allowed."," Under the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention these are the responsibilities of the occupying power."," On 22 May 2003, UN Security Council Resolution 1483 granted authority to the Coalition Provisional Authority to use Iraq's oil revenue."," The programme's remaining funds, $10 billion, were transferred over a 6-month winding-up period to the Development Fund for Iraq under the Coalition Provisional Authority's control; this represented 14% of the programme's total income over 5 years."," The programme was formally terminated on 21 November 2003 and its major functions were turned over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.","[8] The programme also suffered from widespread corruption and abuse.","[9] Until 2001, the money for the Oil-for-Food Programme went through BNP Paribas, whose main private share-holder is Iraqi-born Nadhmi Auchi, a man estimated worth about $1 billion according to Forbes estimates, the 13th-richest man in Britain according to The Guardian."," Auchi received a 15-month suspended sentence for his involvement in the Elf scandal, which the British newspaper called \"the biggest fraud inquiry in Europe since the Second World War\", saying \"Elf became a private bank for its executives who spent   200 million on political favours, mistresses, jewellery, fine art, villas and apartments\".","[10] Elf, an oil company, merged with TotalFina to become Total S."," in 2003.","[clarification needed] According to information from Aqila al-Hashimi, who was senior bureaucrat with the Oil-for-Food Programme in Iraq, of the programme's total of 60 billion dollars, \"roughly 65% was actually applied to aid\".","[11] Over 193 so-called electrical consultants each received $15,000 per month while the electricity only worked a few hours at a time.","[12] Benon Sevan of Cyprus, who headed the programme, defended it, claiming that it had only a 2.","2% administrative cost and that it was subject to more than 100 internal and external audits."," He blamed Security Council restrictions for making the situation difficult and said that 90% of Iraq's population relied on the programme for its monthly food basket.","[13] He ordered his staff to enforce a policy that complaints about illegal payoffs should be formally filed with the whistleblower's country, making them public and allowing Iraq to bar any whistleblowers."," In 2000, Dileep Nair, the UN corruption watchdog, wanted to determine the programme's level of vulnerability.","[14] In response to these criticisms, and to evidence acquired after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, UN Secretary-General accusations were made that skimmed profits were being used to buy influence at the UN and with Kofi Annan himself."," According to an interim report released on 3 February 2005 by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's commission (see #Investigations below), much of the food aid supplied under the programme \"was unfit for human consumption\"."," The report concluded that Sevan had accepted nearly $150,000 in bribes over the course of the programme, and in 2005 he was suspended from his position at the United Nations as a result of the fraud investigation.","[15] Peter van Walsum, the now-retired Ambassador of the Netherlands to the United Nations and chairman of the Iraq Sanctions Committee from 1999 to 2000, speculated in a recent book that Iraq deliberately divided the Security Council by awarding contracts to France, Russia, and China but not to the United Kingdom and the United States."," One of the earliest allegations of wrongdoing in the programme surfaced on 25 January 2004, when al Mada, a daily newspaper in Iraq, published a list of individuals and organizations alleged to have received oil sales contracts via the UN's Oil-for-Food Programme."," The list came from over 15,000 documents which were reportedly found in the state-owned Iraqi oil corporation, the Iraq National Oil Company, which had close links to the Iraqi Oil Ministry.","] to have received the rights to sell 4.","5 million barrels (720,000  m3).","[16][17] The president of Oilexco Ltd, Arthur Millholland, whose name also appeared on the al Mada list, denied wrongdoing but confirmed that illegal surcharges were being paid to the Iraqi government by contractors.","[18] However, the al Mada list does not discuss bribes paid to Iraq     it discusses bribes paid to individuals to support Iraq."," These contracts for Iraqi oil could then be sold on the open world market and the seller was allowed to keep a transaction fee, said to be between $0.","15 and $0.","50/barrel (0.","94 and 3.","14 $/m  ) of oil sold."," Companies that sold commodities via the Oil-for-Food Programme were overcharging by up to 10%, with part of the overcharged amount being diverted into private bank accounts for Saddam Hussein and other regime officials and the other part being kept by the supplier."," The involvement of the UN itself in the scandal began in February 2004 after the name of Benon Sevan, executive director of the Oil-for-Food Programme, appeared on the Iraqi Oil Ministry's documents."," Sevan received vouchers for at least 11,000,000 barrels (1,700,000 m  ) of oil, worth some $3.","5 million in profit."," This French bank was the sole bank administering the $64 billion UN programme."," Investigators estimate that the bank received more than $700 million in fees under the UN programme, which began in 1996 and ended after the ouster of Saddam in March 2003.","[19] The final official version of the Iraq Survey Group report, known as the Duelfer Report, cited only France, Russia and China (countries who were also strongly anti-war) as violators who paid kickbacks.","[citation needed] According to the report, the top three recipients of oil included Russia (30%), France (15%), and China (10%), which are all members of the UN Security Council.","[20] The US received 2   3% of the oil.","[21] US recipients included Exxon Mobil Corp.","[22][verification needed] The list of US companies was originally

personal fortunes of former regime members.","[36] During the execution of this task, the GAO found weaknesses in the programme that allowed kickbacks and other sources of wealth for Saddam

contract they did not like.","[38] Benon Sevan, with support from Kofi Annan, had written letters to all former Oil-for-Food contractors asking them to consult Sevan before releasing any documents to GAO or US congressional inquiry panels.","[39] Throughout its history, the programme had received both complaints from critics saying that it needed to be more open and complaints from companies about proprietary information being disclosed.","[40] Rosett has come under harsh criticism from Denis Halliday[41] and Benon Sevan,[42] who have claimed that many of Rosett's claims (such as Oil-for-Food funding the approval of an Olympic stadium, and where responsibility for various issues lay according to the UN resolutions) were incorrect."," The US House Committee on International Relations

Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela."," The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than 2 trillion barrels (320  billion cubic metres);[5] the estimates include deposits that have not been discovered."," Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels,[6] and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.","67  Gbbl (39.","694  10^9  m3) worldwide, of which 176.","8  Gbbl (28.","11  10^9  m3), or 70.","8%, are in Alberta, Canada.","[3] The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as \"a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow.","\"[7] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate.","[8] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as \"oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000  centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10   API\".","[9] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity.","[10] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria."," According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has \"a gravity of less than 10   API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000  centipoise\".","[9] Oil sands have only recently[when?"," According to a study ordered by the Government of Alberta, Canada, conducted by Jacobs Engineering Group, carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12% higher than from conventional oil.","[11] The exploitation of bituminous deposits and seeps dates back to Paleolithic times.","[12] The earliest known use of bitumen was by Neanderthals, some 40,000  years ago.","[13] In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a Mesopotamian commodity used by the Sumerians and Babylonians, although it was also found in the Levant and Persia."," In Europe, they were extensively mined near the French city of Pechelbronn, where the vapour separation process was in use in 1742.","[14][15] The name tar sands was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century.","[16] People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas for urban heating and lighting.","[17] The word \"tar\" to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a human-made substance produced by the destructive distillation of organic material, usually coal.","[18] Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by natural gas as a fuel, and coal tar as a material for paving roads has been replaced by the petroleum product asphalt."," Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term oil sands (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than tar sands because synthetic oil is manufactured from the bitumen,[18] and due to the feeling that the terminology of tar sands is less politically acceptable to the public.","[19]  Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil.","[20] In Canada, the First Nation peoples had used bitumen from seeps along the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers to waterproof their birch bark canoes from early prehistoric times."," The Canadian oil sands first became known to Europeans in 1719 when a Cree native named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample to Hudsons Bay Company fur trader Henry Kelsey, who commented on it in his journals."," Fur trader Peter Pond paddled down the Clearwater River to Athabasca in 1778, saw the deposits and wrote of \"springs of bitumen that flow along the ground.","\" In 1787, fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie on his way to the Arctic Ocean saw the Athabasca oil sands, and commented, \"At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.","\"[21] The commercial possibilities of Canada's vast oil sands were realized early by Canadian government researchers."," In 1884, Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada commented, \"The banks of the Athabasca would furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel."," In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the material to pave 600  ft (200  m) of road in Edmonton as well as in other places."," In 1920, chemist Karl Clark of the Alberta Research Council began experimenting with methods to extract bitumen from the oil sands and in 1928 he patented the first commercial hot water separation process.","[22] Commercial development began in 1923 when businessman Robert Fitzsimmons began drilling oil wells at Bitumount, north of Fort McMurray but obtained disappointing results with conventional drilling."," In 1927 he formed the International Bitumen Company and in 1930 built a small hot-water separation plant based on Clark's design."," He produced about 300  bbl (50  m3) of bitumen in 1930 and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton."," In 1941 the company was renamed Oil Sands Limited and attempted to iron out technical problems but was never very successful."," It went through several changes of ownership and in 1958 closed down permanently."," In 1974 Bitumount became an Alberta Provincial Historic Site."," In 1930 businessman Max Ball formed Canadian Oil Sand Product, Ltd, which later became Abasand Oils."," He built a separation plant capable of handling 250 tons of oil sands per day which opened in 1936 and produced an average of 200  bbl/d (30  m3/d) of oil."," The plant burned down in late 1941 but was rebuilt in 1942 with even larger capacity."," In 1943 the Canadian government took control of the Abasand plant under the War Measures Act and planned to expand it further."," However in 1945 the plant burned down again and in 1946 the Canadian government abandoned the project because the need for fuel had diminished with the end of the war.","[22] The world's largest deposits of oil sands are in Venezuela and Canada."," They are vast heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20  API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties.","[23] The magnitude of the resources in the two countries is on the order of 3.","5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original oil in place (OOIP)."," Rapid technological developments in Canada in the 1985   2000 period resulted in techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) that can recover a much greater percentage of the OOIP than conventional methods."," The Alberta government estimates that with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m3) of recoverable oil reserves."," Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m3).","[23] This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three largest oil reserves in the world."," Vast deposits of bitumen     over 350 billion cubic metres (2.","2 trillion barrels) of oil in place     exist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan."," If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of North America for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels.","[24] The oil sands of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are a result of the formation of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now comprise most of British Columbia.","[23][25] These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil."," This overthrusting also tilted the pre-Cretaceous sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, depressing the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to 8  km (5  mi) deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the igneous rocks of the Canadian Shield, which outcrop on the surface."," The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about 500 to 700  km (300 to 400  mi)."," Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) sand-silt-shale deposits overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border."," Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil >10  API.","[23][25] Most of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern Alberta."," Between them, they cover over 140,000 square kilometres (54,000  sq  mi)   an area larger than England   and contain approximately 1.","75  Tbbl (280  10^9  m3) of crude bitumen in them."," About 10% of the oil in place, or 173  Gbbl (27.","5  10^9  m3), is estimated by the government of Alberta to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves.","[4] Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using in-situ methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)."," It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about 50  km (30  mi) north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is 400  m (1,300  ft) deep southeast of Fort McMurray."," Only 3% of the oil sands area containing about 20% of the recoverable oil can be produced by surface mining, so the remaining 80% will have to be produced using in-situ wells."," The other Canadian deposits are between 350 to 900  m (1,000 to 3,000  ft) deep and will require in-situ production.","[23][25] The Athabasca oil sands lie along the Athabasca River and are the largest natural bitumen deposit in the world, containing about 80% of the Alberta total, and the only one suitable for surface mining."," With modern unconventional oil production technology, at least 10% of these deposits, or about 170  Gbbl (27  10^9  m3) are considered to be economically recoverable, making Canada's total proven reserves the third largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia's conventional oil and Venezuela's Orinoco oil sands."," They are by far the largest deposit of bitumen in Canada, probably containing over 150 billion cubic metres (900 billion barrels) of oil in place."," The bitumen is highly viscous and is often denser than water (10  API or 1000  kg/m3)."," The oil saturated sands range from 15 to 65 metres (49 to 213  ft) thick in places, and the oil saturation in the oil-rich zones is on the order of 90% bitumen by weight.","[24] The Athabasca River cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed as black stains on the river banks."," The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European fur traders in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the Hudson's Bay Company post at York Factory on Hudson Bay."," In 1778, Peter Pond, a fur trader for the rival North West Company, was the first European to see the Athabasca deposits."," In 1788, fur trader and explorer Alexander Mackenzie from the Hudson Bay Company, who later discovered the Mackenzie River and routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, described the oil sands in great detail."," He said, \"At about 24 miles (39  km) from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet (6.","1  m) long may be inserted without the least resistance.","\" In 1883, G."," In 1888, Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada reported to a Senate Committee that \"The evidence .","\" In 1926, Karl Clark of the University of Alberta patented a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes."," However, it was 1967 before the first large scale commercial operation began with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands mine by the Sun Oil Company of Ohio."," They probably contain over 15 billion cubic metres (90 billion barrels) of oil in place."," The deposit is buried from 100 to 700 metres (330 to 2,300  ft) deep and ranges from 0 to 10 metres (0 to 33  ft) thick."," However, the two deposits are invariable separated by a minimum of 6 metres (20  ft) of clay shale and silt.","[24] The Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of Alberta's capital, Edmonton, near the border with Saskatchewan.","[26] As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production."," They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra-heavy oil-in-place."," The depth of the deposits is 400 to 600 metres (1,300 to 2,000  ft) and they are from 15 to 35 metres (49 to 115  ft) thick.","[24] They are too deep to surface mine."," CFB Cold Lake's CF-18 Hornet jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory."," The Peace River oil sands probably contain over 30 billion cubic metres (200 billion barrels) of oil-in-place."," The thickness of the deposit ranges from 5 to 25 metres (16 to 82  ft) and it is buried about 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300  ft) deep.","[24] Whereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the bitumen can be excavated in open-pit mines, the smaller Peace River deposits are too deep, and must be exploited using in situ methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS).","[27] The Eastern Venezuelan Basin has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale."," The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the Orinoco oil sands where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the Guyana Shield is only about 200 to 300  km (100 to 200  mi)."," The Orinoco deposits are early Tertiary (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits."," In Venezuela, the Orinoco Belt oil sands range from 350 to 1,000  m (1,000 to 3,000  ft) deep and no surface outcrops exist."," The deposit is about 500  km (300  mi) long east-to-west and 50 to 60  km (30 to 40  mi) wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits."," It is approximately 600 kilometres (370  mi) from east to west, and 70 kilometres (43  mi) from north to south, with an area about 55,314 square kilometres (21,357  sq  mi)."," Venezuela's heavy oil deposits of about 1,200  Gbbl (190  10^9  m3) of oil in place are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of lighter oil.","[3] Petr  leos de Venezuela S."," (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, has estimated that the producible reserves of the Orinoco Belt are up to 235  Gbbl (37.","4  10^9  m3)[28] which would make it the largest petroleum reserve in the world."," In 2009, the US Geological Survey (USGS) increased its estimates of the reserves to 513  Gbbl (81.","6  10^9  m3) of oil which is \"technically recoverable (producible using currently available technology and industry practices).","[29] In addition to the three major Canadian oil sands in Alberta, there is a fourth major oil sands deposit in Canada, the Melville Island oil sands in the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future."," Apart from the megagiant[30] oil sands deposits in Canada and Venezuela, numerous other countries hold smaller oil sands deposits."," In the United States, there are supergiant[30] oil sands resources primarily concentrated in Eastern Utah, with a total of 32  Gbbl (5.","1  10^9  m3) of oil (known and potential) in eight major deposits in Carbon, Garfield, Grand, Uintah, and Wayne counties.","[31] In addition to being much smaller than the Canadian oil sands deposits, the US oil sands are hydrocarbon-wet, whereas the Canadian oil sands are water-wet.","[32] This requires somewhat different extraction techniques for the Utah oil sands than those used for the Alberta oil sands.","[3][33] In Kazakhstan, large bitumen deposits are located in the North Caspian Basin.","[34] and larger scale exploitation in the early planning phase.","[35] In the Republic of the Congo reserves are estimated between 0.","5 and 2.","5  Gbbl (79  10^6 and 397  10^6  m3)."," In 2006, bitumen production in Canada averaged 1.","25  Mbbl/d (200,000  m3/d) through 81  oil sands projects."," 44% of Canadian oil production in 2007 was from oil sands.","[36] This proportion was (as of 2008) expected to increase in coming decades as bitumen production grows while conventional oil production declines, although due to the 2008 economic downturn work on new projects has been deferred.","[4] Petroleum is not produced from oil sands on a significant level in other countries.","[32] The Alberta oil sands have been in commercial production since the original Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) mine began operation in 1967.","[citation needed] A second mine, operated by the Syncrude consortium, began operation in 1978 and is the biggest mine of any type in the world."," [purchased by Marathon Oil Corporation in 2007] began operation in 2003."," Petro-Canada was also developing a $33 billion Fort Hills Project, in partnership with UTS Energy Corporation and Teck Cominco, which lost momentum after the 2009 merger of Petro-Canada into Suncor.","[37] By 2013 there were nine oil sands mining projects in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc.","[38] In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen.","[38] No significant development of Venezuela's extra-heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, except for the BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9  API oil by primary production."," This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (Orimulsion) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants.","[23] However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment."," By 2016, with the economy of Venezuela in a tailspin and the country experiencing widespread shortages of food, rolling power blackouts, rioting, and anti-government protests, it was unclear how much new oil sands production would occur in the near future.","[39] In May 2008, the Italian oil company Eni announced a project to develop a small oil sands deposit in the Republic of the Congo."," Production is scheduled to commence in 2014 and is estimated to eventually yield a total of 40,000  bbl/d (6,400  m3/d).","[40] Except for a fraction of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques."," While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.","[41] Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production."," When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8   12%."," Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5   6%.","[42] The Athabasca oil sands are the only major oil sands deposits which are shallow enough to surface mine."," The oil sands themselves are typically 40 to 60 metres (130 to 200  ft) thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated sandstone, sitting on top of flat limestone rock."," Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since."," The Syncrude Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009."," Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine,[43] Imperial Oil's Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by Total S."," Oil sands tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain salts, suspended solids and other dissolvable chemical compounds such as naphthenic acids, benzene, hydrocarbons[44] residual bitumen, fine silts (mature fine tails MFT), and water.","[45] Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of surface mining of the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry.","[45] The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about 77 square kilometres (30  sq  mi).","[45] The Syncrude Tailings Dam or Mildred Lake Settling Basin (MLSB) is an embankment dam that is, by volume of construction material, the largest earth structure in the world in 2001.","[46] Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the sand filters from heavy oil wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved significantly."," The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5   6% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that disposing of the produced sand is a problem.","[47] so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground salt caverns has become more common."," The use of steam injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s."," The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) \"huff-and-puff\" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10   40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60   70% of OIP).","[48] CSS has been in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River."," First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months.","[49] Steam assisted gravity drainage was developed in the 1980s by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority and fortuitously coincided with improvements in directional drilling technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s."," In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it.","[49] SAGD has proved to be a major breakthrough in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place."," Examples include Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS) project, Suncor's Firebag project, Nexen's Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, Husky Energy's Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, Cenovus Energy's Foster Creek[50] and Christina Lake[51] developments, ConocoPhillips' Surmont project, Devon Canada's Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project.","[52] Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam.","[53] This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well.","[54] Advocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less greenhouse gases, and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques.","[55] Petrobank Energy and Resources has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to 400  bbl/d (64  m3/d) per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12  API degrees."," The company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion)[56] system, which pulls the oil through a catalyst lining the lower pipe.","[57][58][59] After several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned.","[60] This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone."," It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.","[61] Approximately 1.","0   1.","25 gigajoules (280   350  kWh) of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude."," As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas.","[62]  Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about 6.","117 gigajoules (1,699  kWh), its EROEI is 5   6."," That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed."," Energy efficiency is expected to improve to an average of 900 cubic feet (25  m3) of natural gas or 0.","945 gigajoules (262  kWh) of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.","5.","[63] Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area."," Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30   35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude.","[64] Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high."," When the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4   7% that is typically found in bitumen."," Western Canadian Select, launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the Husky Energy terminal in Hardisty, Alberta,[65] is the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the benchmark for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes.","[66] [67]:9 [68] [69]  WCS is traded at Cushing, Oklahoma, a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America."," While its major component is bitumen, it also contains a combination of sweet synthetic and condensate diluents, and 25 existing streams of both conventional and unconventional oil[70] making it a syndilbit    both a dilbit and a synbit.","[71]:16 The first step in upgrading is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions."," Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.","5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.","[72] In 2012, Alberta produced about 1,900,000  bbl/d (300,000  m3/d) of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about 1,044,000  bbl/d (166,000  m3/d) was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen."," These include:[73][74] Modernized and new large refineries such as are found in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO."," Typically, blended bitumen contains about 30% natural gas condensate or other diluents and 70% bitumen."," The demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than 750,000  bbl/d (119,000  m3/d) by 2020, double 2012 volumes."," Since Western Canada only produces about 150,000  bbl/d (24,000  m3/d) of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport."," To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport 95,000  bbl/d (15,100  m3/d) of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships 180,000  bbl/d (29,000  m3/d) of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another 100,000  bbl/d (16,000  m3/d).","[75] Although Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature."," The upgraders have a combined capacity of 630,000  bbl/d (100,000  m3/d), which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil.","[76] A network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta."," In 2012, the capacity of the southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m  /d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added.","[77] From Edmonton and Hardisty, main transmission pipelines move blended bitumen and SCO, as well as conventional crude oil and various oil and natural productions to market destinations across North America."," The main transmission systems include:[77] Overall, the total pipeline capacity for the movement of crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty to the rest of North America is about 3.","5  10^6  bbl/d (560,000  m3/d)."," In 2012, the Canadian export pipeline system began to become overloaded with new oil production.","[73] In addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located."," The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems:[73] With the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines.","[73] In addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta.","[77] A single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move 630,000  bbl/d (100,000  m3/d) to 780,000  bbl/d (124,000  m3/d), which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline."," This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad."," By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Canadian National Railway (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30   35 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver."," Two US Class 1 railways, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and BNSF Railway handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors.","[77] CN Rail has said that it could move 1,500,000  bbl/d (240,000  m3/d) of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of Prince Rupert, BC if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of Kitimat, BC was not approved."," At present rail moves over 90,000  bbl/d (14,000  m3/d) of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future.","[73] By 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from 16,000  bbl/d (2,500  m3/d) in early 2012 to 146,000  bbl/d (23,200  m3/d) in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays."," The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in Lac Megantic, Quebec.","[82] The ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people."," The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished."," By 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies."," It was moving about 70,000  bbl/d (11,000  m3/d) to Cushing, Oklahoma, and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline     which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays.","[83] Suncor has also been moving 20,000  bbl/d (3,200  m3/d) of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its Montreal Refinery with plans to increase it to 35,000  bbl/d (5,600  m3/d)."," Suncor claimed this saved about $10/bbl off the price of buying offshore oil."," However, it was also anticipating the reversal of Enbridge's Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver 300,000  bbl/d (48,000  m3/d) oil even cheaper.","[84] Heavy crude oil feedstock#crude feedstock needs pre-processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves.","[85] There are four major oil refineries in Alberta which supply most of Western Canada with petroleum products, but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately 1,900,000  bbl/d (300,000  m3/d) of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta."," The four major Alberta refineries are:[86] The $8.","5-billion Sturgeon Refinery, a fifth major Alberta refinery, is under construction near Fort Saskatchewan with a completion date of 2017.","[87][88] The proponents are Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, Canadian Natural Resources Limited and North West Upgrading Inc."," NWU, which was founded in 2004, is a private, Alberta-based company with headquarters in Calgary.","[88] Canadian Natural Resources Limited 50/50 entered into a joint venture partnership with NWU in February 2011[88] forming North West Redwater Partnership."," This is the first oil refinery to be constructed in Alberta in thirty years     the last was Shell   s Scotford refinery which was completed in 1984.","[87][89] The Sturgeon Refinery is the \"first new refinery to be built with a carbon capture and storage system.","\"[90] The plant is designed to convert up to 150,000  bbl/d (24,000  m3/d) of crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel.","\"[87] The refinery will process bitumen into diesel fuel not SCO so it is more of an upgrader than a refinery.","\"[90] By June 2014 the estimated cost of construction had increased from $5.","7 billion to $8.","5 billion[87]     or $170,000 per barrel of new capacity.","[90] The Alberta government has guaranteed NWU's loans and signed a firm contract for feedstock deliveries because of some economic issues."," Alberta levies royalties on bitumen at \"before payout\" (2%) and \"after payout\" (25%) rates, and accepts payments \"in kind\" rather than \"in cash.","\" (BRIK), Alberta will receive 300,000 bpd of bitumen under this BRIK program."," With bitumen production expected to reach 5,000,000  bbl/d (790,000  m3/d) by 2035, it means that after the projects pay out, the Alberta government will have 1,250,000  bbl/d (200,000  m3/d) of bitumen to sell.","[89] The Pacific Future Energy project proposes a new refinery in British Columbia that would bring in Western Canadian bitumen and process it into fuels for Asian and Canadian markets.","[91] Canadian oil exports have increased tenfold since 1980, mostly as the result of new oil sands bitumen and heavy oil output, but at the same time Canadian oil consumption and refining capacity has hardly grown at all."," Since the 1970s, the number of oil refineries in Canada has declined from 40 to 19."," There hasn't been a new oil refinery (other than oil sands upgraders) built in Canada since 1984."," Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada."," At the same time Canada imports 700,000  bbl/d (110,000  m3/d) of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US.","[92] Canadian refineries, outside of the major oil producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built on the assumption that light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production.","[92] Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world.","[93] Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined."," American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from 450,000  bbl/d (72,000  m3/d) in 1981 to 3,120,000  bbl/d (496,000  m3/d) in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined.","[94] However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences."," For the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new benchmark crude oil called Western Canadian Select, (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils."," This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19   21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as \"conventional heavy oil\" by governments."," The Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around 1,900,000  bbl/d (300,000  m3/d) by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production."," It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035."," This implies that over 3,200,000  bbl/d (510,000  m3/d) of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market."," In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production."," The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity     The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of 300,000  bbl/d (48,000  m3/d) supplying refineries in B."," However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional 500,000  bbl/d (79,000  m3/d) to 1,100,000  bbl/d (170,000  m3/d) to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world.","[95] In recent years, Chinese oil companies such as China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and PetroChina have bought over $30 billion in assets in Canadian oil sands projects, so they would probably like to export some of their newly acquired oil to China.","[96] The world's largest deposits of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's deposits of extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger."," In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export."," The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.","[97] Canada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels)."," Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent."," At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m3 (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen.","  At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller.","[98][99] Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the price of oil."," The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at Cushing, Oklahoma above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production."," The Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel.","[73] These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors."," Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011,[100] production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets."," The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.","32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.","57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.","02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.","30/bbl.","[101] Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable."," Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining."," Then in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U."," production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015.","[102]  In 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.","65/bbl, and 70.","18/bbl for mining without upgrading."," Including costs of blending and transportation, the WTI equivalent supply costs for delivery to Cushing become US$80.","06/bbl for SAGD projects, and US$89.","71/bbl for a standalone mine.","[98] In this economic environment, plans for further development of production from oil sands have been slowed or deferred,[103]  [104] or even abandoned during construction.","[105]    Production of synthetic crude from mining operations continue at a loss because of the costs of shutdown and restart, as well as commitments to supply contracts.","[106] Oil sands production forecasts released by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production.","[107] Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming that the price of oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.","3 million m3/d (8.","3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead."," Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m3/d (5.","0 million barrels/day), 2.","6 times the production for 2012."," Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods."," In November 2015, U.","[108]  In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods.","[99] A shortage of skilled workers in the Canadian oil sands developed during periods of rapid development of new projects.","[97] The skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002   03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands."," As of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations.","[103] Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the European Community and China.","[109] There is also the possibility that there will emerge an international agreement to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2    C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels.","[110] Rapid technological progress is being made to reduce the cost of competing renewable sources of energy.","[111]  Hence there is no consensus about when, if ever, oil prices paid to producers may substantially recover.","[109][111][112] A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2    C."," To meet the 2    C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market."," Open-pit mining of natural bitumen in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production.","[113][114][115] In their 2011 commissioned report entitled \"Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America   s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources,\" the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the U.","\"[116] Oil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions.","[117]  Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process.","[118]  The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.","[119][120] In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada.","[121] The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as \"highly polluting\".","[122] According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta   s oilsands."," The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.","[123][124] In 2014 results of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough.","[125][126] The Alberta government computes an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a \"partner\" called the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA).","  Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), total reduced sulfur (TRS), Ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM2.","5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), total hydrocarbons (THC), and methane/non-methane hydrocarbons (CH4/NMHC).","[127] These AQHI are said to indicate 'low risk\"'air quality more than 95% of the time.","[128]  Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders.","[129] In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for H2S) exceeded standards.","[130] The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance[131] (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 ppb for H2S, and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012.","[132] In September 2015, the Pembina Institute published a brief report about \"a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta associated with the expansion of oilsands development\", contrasting the responses to these concerns in Peace River and Fort McKay.","  In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the

technology advancements in semiconductor device fabrication.","  Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more transistors on chips of the same size   a modern chip may have many billions of transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail.","  These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.","  An integrated circuit is defined as:[1] A circuit in which all or some of the circuit elements are inseparably associated and electrically interconnected so that it is considered to be indivisible for the purposes of construction and commerce.","[2][3] Arguably, the first examples of integrated circuits would include the Loewe 3NF.","[4] Although far from a monolithic construction, it certainly meets the definition given above."," Early developments of the integrated circuit go back to 1949, when German engineer Werner Jacobi (Siemens  AG)[5] filed a patent for an integrated-circuit-like semiconductor amplifying device[6] showing five transistors on a common substrate in a 3-stage amplifier arrangement."," The idea of the integrated circuit was conceived by Geoffrey Dummer (1909   2002), a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the British Ministry of Defence."," on 7 May 1952.","[7] He gave many symposia publicly to propagate his ideas and unsuccessfully attempted to build such a circuit in 1956."," This idea, which seemed very promising in 1957, was proposed to the US Army by Jack Kilby and led to the short-lived Micromodule Program (similar to 1951's Project Tinkertoy).","[8][9][10] However, as the project was gaining momentum, Kilby came up with a new, revolutionary design: the  IC."," Newly employed by Texas Instruments, Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.","[11] In his patent application of 6 February 1959,[12] Kilby described his new device as \"a body of semiconductor material     wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated.","\"[13] The first customer for the new invention was the US Air Force.","[14] Kilby won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for his part in the invention of the integrated circuit.","[15] His work was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009.","[16] Half a year after Kilby, Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor developed a new variety of integrated circuit, more practical than Kilby's implementation.","[17]  This isolation allows each transistor to operate independently despite being parts of the same piece of silicon."," The technology was developed by Italian physicist Federico Faggin in 1968."," In 1970, he joined Intel in order to develop the first single-chip central processing unit (CPU) microprocessor, the Intel 4004, for which he received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2010."," The 4004 was designed by Busicom's Masatoshi Shima and Intel's Ted Hoff in 1969, but it was Faggin's improved design in 1970 that made it a reality.","[18] Advances in IC technology, primarily smaller features and larger chips, have allowed the number of transistors in an integrated circuit to double every two years, a trend known as Moore's law.","[19] Because speed, capacity, and power consumption gains are apparent to the end user, there is fierce competition among the manufacturers to use finer geometries."," Over the years, transistor sizes have decreased from 10s of microns in the early 1970s to 10 nanometers in 2017 [20] with a corresponding million-fold increase in transistors per unit area.","  As of 2016, typical chip areas range from a few square millimeters to around 600  mm2, with up to 25 million transistors per mm2.","[21] The expected shrinking of feature sizes and the needed progress in related areas was forecast for many years by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS).","  The final ITRS was issued in 2016, and it is being replaced by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems.","[22] Initially, ICs were strictly electronic devices."," As of  2018[update], the vast majority of all transistors are fabricated in a single layer on one side of a chip of silicon in a flat 2-dimensional planar process.","[31]  Therefore, it only makes economic sense to produce integrated circuit products with high production volume, so the non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs are spread across typically millions of production units.","  Electronic Design Automation (EDA), also referred to as Electronic Computer-Aided Design (ECAD),[32] is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems, including integrated circuits."," Integrated circuits can be classified into analog,[33] digital[34] and mixed signal,[35] consisting of both analog and digital signaling on the same IC."," Digital integrated circuits can contain anywhere from one[36] to billions[21] of logic gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and other circuits in a few square millimeters."," In the 1980s, programmable logic devices were developed."," Current devices called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can (as of 2016) implement the equivalent of millions of gates in parallel and operate at frequencies up to 1 GHz.","[37] Analog ICs, such as sensors, power management circuits, and operational amplifiers (op-amps), work by processing continuous signals.","  Prior to the late 1990s, radios could not be fabricated in the same low-cost CMOS processes as microprocessors."," But since 1998, a large number of radio chips have been developed using CMOS processes."," Examples include Intel's DECT cordless phone, or 802.","11 (Wi-Fi) chips created by Atheros and other companies.","[38] Modern electronic component distributors often further sub-categorize the huge variety of integrated circuits now available: The semiconductors of the periodic table of the chemical elements were identified as the most likely materials for a solid-state vacuum tube."," Starting with copper oxide, proceeding to germanium, then silicon, the materials were systematically studied in the 1940s and 1950s."," Each good die (plural dice, dies, or die) is then connected into a package using aluminium (or gold) bond wires which are thermosonically bonded[39] to pads, usually found around the edge of the die."," Test cost can account for over 25% of the cost of fabrication on lower-cost products, but can be negligible on low-yielding, larger, or higher-cost devices."," As of  2016[update], a fabrication facility (commonly known as a semiconductor fab) can cost over US$8 billion to construct.","[40]  The cost of a fabrication facility rises over time because of increased complexity of new products."," In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to pin grid array (PGA) and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages."," Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package     a carrier which occupies an area about 30   50% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner."," This package has \"gull wing\" leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of 0.","050  inches."," In the late 1990s, plastic quad flat pack (PQFP) and thin small-outline package (TSOP) packages became the most common for high pin count devices, though PGA packages are still used for high-end microprocessors."," Ball grid array (BGA) packages have existed since the 1970s."," Flip-chip Ball Grid Array packages, which allow for much higher pin count than other package types, were developed in the 1990s."," Intel transitioned away from PGA to land grid array (LGA) and BGA beginning in 2004, with the last PGA socket released in 2014 for mobile platforms.","  As of  2018[update], AMD uses PGA packages on mainstream desktop processors,[43] BGA packages on mobile processors,[44] and high-end desktop and server microprocessors use LGA packages.","[45] Traces[clarification needed] going out of the die, through the package, and into the printed circuit board have very different electrical properties, compared to on-chip signals."," The manufacturing date is commonly represented as a two-digit year followed by a two-digit week code, such that a part bearing the code 8341 was manufactured in week 41 of 1983, or approximately in October 1983."," The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 established intellectual property protection for photomasks used to produce integrated circuits.","[46] A diplomatic conference was held at Washington, D.",", in 1989, which adopted a Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits (IPIC Treaty)."," The Treaty on Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits, also called Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty (signed at Washington on 26 May 1989) is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.","[47] National laws protecting IC layout designs have been adopted in a number of countries, including Japan,[48] the EC,[49] the UK, Australia, and Korea.","[50] Future developments seem to follow the multi-core multi-microprocessor paradigm, already used by Intel and AMD multi-core processors."," and IBM started shipping the KC256 in 2006, a 256-core microprocessor."," Intel, as recently as February   August 2011, unveiled a prototype, \"not for commercial sale\" chip that bears 80 cores."," Parallel programming languages such as the open-source X10 programming language are designed to assist with this task.","[51] In the early days of simple integrated circuits, the technology's large scale limited each chip to only a few transistors, and the low degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple."," As the technology progressed, millions, then billions[52] of transistors could be placed on one chip, and good designs required thorough planning, giving rise to the field of electronic design automation, or EDA."," Early digital circuits containing tens of transistors provided a few logic gates, and early linear ICs such as the Plessey SL201 or the Philips TAA320 had as few as two transistors."," Although the Apollo guidance computer led and motivated integrated-circuit technology,[55] it was the Minuteman missile that forced it into mass-production."," The Minuteman missile program and various other United States Navy programs accounted for the total $4 million integrated circuit market in 1962, and by 1968, U."," Government spending on space and defense still accounted for 37% of the $312 million total production."," The average price per integrated circuit dropped from $50.","00 in 1962 to $2.","33 in 1968.","[56] Integrated circuits began to appear in consumer products by the turn of the 1970s decade.","[57] The next step in the development of integrated circuits, taken in the late 1960s, introduced devices which contained hundreds of transistors on each chip, called \"medium-scale integration\" (MSI)."," In 1964, Frank Wanlass demonstrated a single-chip 16-bit shift register he designed, with a then-incredible 120 transistors on a single chip.","[57][58] MSI devices were attractive economically because while they cost a little more to produce than SSI devices, they allowed more complex systems to be produced using smaller circuit boards, less assembly work because of fewer separate components, and a number of other advantages."," Further development, driven by the same economic factors, led to \"large-scale integration\" (LSI) in the mid-1970s, with tens of thousands of transistors per chip."," The masks used to process and manufacture SSI, MSI and early LSI and VLSI devices (such as the microprocessors of the early 1970s) were mostly created by hand, often using Rubylith-tape or similar.","[59] For large or complex ICs (such as memories or processors), this was often done by specially hired professionals in charge of circuit layout, placed under the supervision of a team of engineers, who would also, along with the circuit designers, inspect and verify the correctness and completeness of each mask."," Integrated circuits such as 1K-bit RAMs, calculator chips, and the first microprocessors, that began to be manufactured in moderate quantities in the early 1970s, had under 4,000 transistors."," True LSI circuits, approaching 10,000 transistors, began to be produced around 1974, for computer main memories and second-generation microprocessors."," The 7400 series of TTL chips, for example, has become a de facto standard and remains in production."," The final step in the development process, starting in the 1980s and continuing through the present, was \"very-large-scale integration\" (VLSI)."," The development started with hundreds of thousands of transistors in the early 1980s, As of  2016[update], transistor counts continue to grow beyond ten billion transistors per chip.","[60] In 1986 the first one-megabit random-access memory (RAM) chips were introduced, containing more than one million transistors."," Microprocessor chips passed the million-transistor mark in 1989 and the billion-transistor mark in 2005.","[61] The trend continues largely unabated, with chips introduced in 2007 containing tens of billions of memory transistors.","[62] To reflect further growth of the complexity, the term ULSI that stands for \"ultra-large-scale integration\" was proposed for chips of more than 1 million transistors.","[63] Wafer-scale integration (WSI) is a means of building very large integrated circuits that uses an entire silicon wafer to produce a single \"super-chip\".","[64] A system-on-a-chip (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit in which all the components needed for a computer or other system are included on a single chip.","[65] Further, signal sources and destinations are physically closer on die, reducing the length of wiring and therefore latency, transmission power costs and waste heat from communication between modules on the same chip."," A three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) has

to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data."," It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64 kilobit/s."," In some countries, ISDN found major market application for Internet access, in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128

entry level interface to ISDN is the Basic Rate Interface (BRI), a 128 kbit/s service delivered over a pair of standard telephone copper wires.","[4] The 144 kbit/s payload rate is broken down into two 64 kbit/s bearer channels ('B' channels) and one 16 kbit/s signaling channel ('D' channel or data channel)."," This is sometimes referred to as 2B+D.","[5] The interface specifies the following network interfaces: BRI-ISDN is very popular in Europe but is much less common in North America."," It is also common in Japan      where it is known as INS64.","[6][7] The other ISDN access available

channel of 64 kbit/s."," This is often referred to as 30B+2D.","[8] In North America PRI service is delivered on one or more T1 carriers (often referred to as 23B+D) of 1544 kbit/s (24 channels)."," A PRI has 23 'B' channels and 1 'D' channel for signalling (Japan uses a circuit called a J1, which is similar to a T1)."," Inter-changeably but incorrectly, a PRI is referred to as T1 because it uses the T1 carrier format."," A true T1 (commonly called \"Analog T1\" to avoid confusion) uses 24 channels of 64 kbit/s of in-band signaling."," Each channel uses 56 kb for data and voice and 8 kb for

launch of ADSL in 2003, the importance of ISDN for data transfer began to decrease and is today limited to niche business applications with point-to-point requirements."," A study[27] of the German Department of Science shows the following spread of ISDN-channels per 1,000 inhabitants in the year 2005: In ISDN, there are two types of channels, B (for \"bearer\") and D (for \"data\")."," Basic Rate Interface (BRI), also called basic rate access (BRA)      consists of two B channels, each with bandwidth of 64 kbit/s, and one D channel with a bandwidth of 16 kbit/s."," Together these three channels can be designated as 2B+D."," Primary Rate Interface (PRI), also called primary rate access (PRA) in Europe      contains a greater number of B channels and a D channel with a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s."," The number of B channels for PRI varies according to the nation: in North America and Japan it is 23B+1D, with an aggregate bit rate of 1.","544 Mbit/s (T1); in Europe, India and Australia it is 30B+2D, with an aggregate bit rate of 2.","048 Mbit/s (E1)."," Another alternative ISDN configuration can be used in which the B channels of an ISDN BRI line are bonded to provide a total duplex bandwidth of 128 kbit/s."," The B channels of several BRIs can be bonded, a typical use is a 384K videoconferencing channel."," Once a call is set up, there is a simple 64 kbit/s synchronous bidirectional data channel (actually implemented as two simplex channels, one in each direction) between the end parties, lasting until the call is terminated."," Bearer channels may also be multiplexed into what may be considered single, higher-bandwidth channels via a process called B channel BONDING, or via use of Multi-Link PPP \"bundling\" or by using an H0, H11, or H12 channel on a PRI.","25 data packets, and connection to X.","25 packet network, this is specified in X.","31.","31 was only commercially implemented in the UK, France, Japan and Germany."," Most NT-1 devices can perform the functions of the NT2 as well, and so the S and T reference points are generally collapsed into the S/T reference point."," In North America, the NT1 device is considered customer premises equipment (CPE) and must be maintained by the customer, thus, the U interface is provided to the customer."," In other locations, the NT1 device is maintained by the telco, and the S/T interface is provided to the customer."," In India, service providers provide U interface and an NT1 may be supplied by Service provider as part of service offering."," Among the kinds of data that can be moved over the 64 kbit/s channels are pulse-code modulated voice calls, providing access to the traditional voice PSTN."," However, ISDN is typically more reliable than POTS, and has a significantly faster call setup time compared with POTS, and IP connections over ISDN typically have some 30   35ms round trip time, as opposed to 120   180ms (both measured with otherwise unused lines) over 56k or

Wales by the end of the second century AD\".","[20] Evidence of trade in coal, dated to about AD 200, has been found at the Roman settlement at Heronbridge, near Chester; and in the Fenlands of East

to be referred to as \"seacoal\" in the 13th century; the wharf where the material arrived in London was known as Seacoal Lane, so identified in a charter of King Henry III granted in 1253.","[25] Initially, the name was given because much coal was found on the shore, having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops,[24] but by the time of Henry VIII, it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to London by sea.","[26] In 1257   1259, coal from Newcastle upon Tyne was shipped to London for the smiths and lime-burners

employees of the coal industry die every year from the effects of breathing in coal mine dust.","[85] Around 10% of coal is ash,[86] Coal ash is hazardous and toxic to human beings and other living things.","[87] Coal ash contains the radioactive elements uranium and thorium.","[88] Huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually."," In 2013, the US alone consumed on the order of

infant mortality by 6   8% and that industrial coal use explains roughly one-third of the urban mortality penalty observed during this period.","\"[93] Coal mining and coal fueling of power station and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage.","[94] Water systems are affected by coal mining.","[95] For example, mining affects groundwater and water table levels and acidity.","[96] One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the water cycle was acid rain."," Approximately 75 Tg/S per year of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is released from burning coal."," After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H2SO2 which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate."," However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,[97] whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years."," Release of SO2 also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.","[98] Disused coal mines can also cause issues.","[99] For example, there is a coal seam fire in Germany that has been burning since 1668, and is still burning in the 21st century.","[100] The production of coke from coal produces ammonia, coal tar, and gaseous compounds as by-products which if discharged to land, air or waterways can act as environmental

electric power generation emits around a tonne of carbon dioxide, which is double the approximately 500kg of carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant.","[104] Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the market in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions may have fallen.","[105] Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.","[106] In 2013, the head of the UN climate agency advised that most of the

Historically, the primary focus was on SO2 and NOx, the most important gases which caused acid rain, and particulates which cause visible air pollution and deleterious effects on human health."," SO2 can be removed by flue-gas desulfurization and NO2 by selective catalytic reduction (SCR)."," And mercury emissions can be reduced up to 95%.","[108] However capturing carbon dioxide emissions is generally not economically viable."," Local pollution standards include GB13223-2011 (China), India[109], the Industrial Emissions Directive (EU) and the Clean Air Act (United States)."," Satellite monitoring is now used to crosscheck national data, for example that Chinese control of SO2 has only been partially successful.","[110] It has also revealed that low use of technology such as SCR has resulted in high NO2 emissions in South Africa and India.","[111] A few Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plants have been built with coal gasification.","[112][113] Although still being intensively researched and considered economically viable for some uses other than with coal; carbon capture and storage is being tested at the Petra Nova and Boundary Dam coal-fired power plants and so far has been found to be technically feasible but not economically viable for use with coal, due to reductions in the cost of solar PV technology.","[114] Opposition to coal pollution was one of the main reasons the modern environmental movement started in the 19th century."," Many countries have now transitioned away from coal[115] some using the ideas of a \"just transition\", for example to use some of the benefits of transition to provide early pensions for coal miners.","[116] Some coal miners are concerned their jobs may be lost in the transition.","[117] The white rot fungus Trametes versicolor can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal.","[118] The bacteria Diplococcus has been found to degrade coal, raising its temperature.","[119] In the

millions of dollars.","[122] The economies most damaged by coal (via climate change) may be India and the US as they are the countries with the highest social cost of carbon.","[123] China is the largest producer of coal in the world."," It is the world's largest energy consumer, and coal in China supplies 60% of its primary energy."," Air pollution from coal storage and handling costs the USA almost 200 dollars for every extra ton stored, due to PM2.","5.","[124] Coal pollution costs the EU    43 billion each year.","[125] Measures to cut air pollution have beneficial long-term economic

example, in Roman Britain, the Romans were exploiting most of the major coalfields by the late 2nd century AD.","[1] The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power steam engines.","[2] Coal-cutting machines were introduced in the 1880s."," By 1912, surface mining was conducted with steam shovels designed for coal mining.","[3] Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining."," The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately 180  ft (55  m), are usually surface mined."," Coal that occurs at depths of 180 to 300  ft (55 to 90  m) are usually deep mined, but in some cases surface mining techniques can be used."," coal that occur at depths in excess of 200  ft (60  m) are mined by the open pit methods, due to thickness of the seam 60   90 feet (20   25 metres)."," Coals occurring below 300  ft (90  m) are usually deep mined.","[4] However, there are open pit mining operations working on coal seams up to 1,000   1,500 feet (300   460 metres) below ground level, for instance Tagebau Hambach in Germany.","[5] Most open cast mines in the United States extract bituminous coal."," Surface mining accounts for around 80 percent of production in Australia, while in the US it is used for about 67 percent of production."," Globally, about 40 percent of coal production involves surface mining.","[5] Strip mining exposes coal by removing earth above each coal seam."," The life of some area mines may be more than 50 years.","[6] The contour mining method consists of removing overburden from the seam in a pattern following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside."," A ridge of undisturbed natural material 15 to 20  ft (5 to 6  m) wide is often intentionally left at the outer edge of the mined area.","[4] The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice of creating head-of-hollow-fills, or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.","[7][8] Spoil is placed at the head of a narrow, steep-sided valley or hollow.","[6] Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining, a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.","[5] In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof."," There are six principal methods of underground mining: Coal is mined commercially in over 50 countries."," Over 7,036 Mt/yr of hard coal was produced in 2007, a substantial increase over the previous 25 years.","[9] In 2006, the world production of brown coal (lignite) was slightly over 1,000 Mt, with Germany the world's largest brown coal producer at 194.","4 Mt, and China second at 100.","6 Mt.","[10] Coal production has grown fastest in Asia, while Europe has declined."," Since 2013, the world coal production is decreasing, -6% in 2016.","[11] The top coal mining nations are: Most coal production is used in the country of origin, with around 16 percent of hard coal production being exported."," Coal reserves are available in almost every country worldwide, with recoverable reserves in around 70 countries."," At current production levels, proven coal reserves are estimated to last 147 years.","[13] However, production levels are by no means level, and are in fact increasing and some estimates are that peak coal could arrive in many countries such as China and America by around 2030."," Coal reserves are usually stated as either (1) \"Resources\" (\"measured\" + \"indicated\" + \"inferred\" = \"resources\", and then, a smaller number, often only 10-20% of \"resources,\" (2) \"Run of Mine\" (ROM) reserves, and finally (3) \"marketable reserves\", which may be only 60% of ROM reserves.","[14] In the United States, the increase in technology has significantly decreased the mining workforce."," in 2015 US coal mines had 65,971 employees, the lowest figure since EIA began collecting data in 1978.","[15] However, a 2016 study reported that a relatively minor investment would allow most coal workers to retrain for the solar energy industry.","[16] Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one."," In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents in the twentieth century,[17] 90 percent of the fatalities occurring in the first half of the century.","[18] More than 3,200 died in 1907 alone.","[19] Open cut hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse, rock burst, outbursts, and gas explosions."," Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.","[20] However, in lesser developed countries and some developing countries, many miners continue to die annually, either through direct accidents in coal mines or through adverse health consequences from working under poor conditions."," China, in particular, has the highest number of coal mining related deaths in the world, with official statistics claiming that 6,027 deaths occurred in 2004.","[21] To compare, 28 deaths were reported in the US in the same year.","[22] Coal production in China is twice that in the US,[23] while the number of coal miners is around 50 times that of the US, making deaths in coal mines in China 4 times as common per worker (108 times as common per unit output) as in the US."," Mine disasters have still occurred in recent years in the US,[24] Examples include the Sago Mine disaster of 2006, and the 2007 mine accident in Utah's Crandall Canyon Mine, where nine miners were killed and six entombed.","[25] In the decade 2005-2014, US coal mining fatalities averaged 28 per year.","[26] The most fatalities during the 2005-2014 decade were 48 in 2010, the year of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia, which killed 29 miners.","[27] Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy."," In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.","2 percent of workers).","[28] The use of water sprays in mining equipment reduces the risk to miners' lungs.","[29] Build-ups of a hazardous gas are known as damps, possibly from the German word \"Dampf\" which means steam or vapor: Noise is also a contributing factor to potential adverse effects on coal miners' health."," To protect miners' hearing, the US Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) guidelines for noise place a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for noise at 90 dBA time-weighted over 8 hours."," A lower cutoff, 85 dBA, is set for a worker to fall into the MSHA Action Level which dictates that workers be placed into hearing conservation programs."," For example, a study has found that among surface coal mine operations, dragline equipment produced the loudest sound at a range of 88-112 dBA."," [30] Within longwall sections, stageloaders used to transport coal from the mining face and shearers used for extraction represent some of the highest noise exposures.","  Auxiliary fans (up to 120 dBA), continuous mining machines (up to 109 dBA), and roof bolters (up to 103 dBA) represent some of the noisiest equipment within continuous mining sections."," [31] Exposures to noise exceeding 90 dBA can lead to adverse effects on workers' hearing."," In the 1966 Aberfan disaster in Wales, a colliery spoil tip collapsed, engulfing a school and killing 116 children and 28 adults."," Other accidents involving coal waste include the Martin County coal slurry spill (USA, 2000) and the Obed Mountain coal mine spill (Canada, 2013).","[32] Another innovation in recent years is the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised.","[33] Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds."," However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate.","[34][verification needed] However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.","[34] Coal mining can result in a number of adverse effects on the environment.","[35] This often results in a scarred landscape with no scenic value."," Rehabilitation or reclamation mitigates some of these concerns and is required by US Federal Law, specifically the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.","[36] Top 10 hard and brown coal producers in 2012 were (in million

a long history of commercial exploitation starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar River."," Demand for coal remained low until the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853."," After this, production rose to an annual average of 1 Mt and India produced 6.","12 Mt per year by 1900 and 18 Mt

Minister of Australia since August 2018."," The partnership between the two current parties dates back to 1946, shortly after the Liberal Party was formed, and has continued almost uninterrupted since then."," The first such federal arrangement was formed in 1923, as a solution to the hung parliament that resulted from the 1922 federal election."," In the Northern Territory the territorial parties merged in 1974 to form the Country Liberal Party (CLP), and in 2008 the Queensland state-level parties merged, forming the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP)."," The origins of the Coalition date back to the 1922 federal election, when the Nationalist Party, the main middle-class non-Labor party of the time, lost the absolute majority it had held since its formation in 1917."," The Country Party's terms were unusually stiff for a prospective junior partner in a Westminster system (and especially so for a relatively new party)--five seats in an 11-member cabinet, as well as the Treasurer's post and second rank in the ministry for Page."," The Nationalist   Country Coalition was reelected twice, and continued in office until its defeat in 1929."," The Country Party and the Nationalists' successor party, the United Australia Party, fought the 1931 federal election with a joint Senate ticket, though they ran separate House tickets."," However, the parties once again joined in a full Coalition government following the 1934 federal election."," After the death of Prime Minister Joseph Lyons in April 1939, Page was appointed as his successor on an interim basis, pending the new election of a new UAP leader."," However, a number of Page's colleagues disagreed with his stance, and he resigned as leader in September 1939."," He was replaced by Archie Cameron, and after months of negotiations the coalition was revived in March 1940, with five Country MPs joining the second Menzies Ministry."," After losing eight seats at the 1940 federal election, the Coalition was plunged into minority government for the first and only time in its history."," With this in mind, in August 1941 the Coalition collectively decided that Fadden and Menzies should swap positions, with Menzies becoming Minister for Defence Co-ordination and Fadden becoming prime minister."," Up until the 1943 election, the Coalition effectively operated as a single unit, with separate party meetings being extremely rare."," The Liberal Party replaced the UAP in 1945, and in the lead-up to the 1946 federal election renewed the Coalition with the Country Party."," They won the 1949 federal election as a Coalition, and stayed in office for a record 23 years."," Since 1946, the Coalition has remained intact with two exceptions, both in opposition."," The parties decided not to form a coalition opposition following their defeat in 1972, but went into the 1974 federal election as a Coalition.","[3] The Coalition remained together upon entering opposition in 1983 federal election."," The Coalition suffered another break, related to the \"Joh for Canberra\" campaign, from April to August 1987, the rift healing after the 1987 federal election.","[4] The solidity of the Coalition is so strong that when the Liberals won parliamentary majorities in their own right in the 1975, 1977 and 1996 federal elections, the Coalition was retained."," It was a government of the Nationalist Party of Australia, a forerunner to the modern Liberal party which introduced the legislation, following Labor's unexpected win at the 1918 Swan by-election where the conservative vote split."," Due to a disciplined coalition between the parties and their predecessors being in existence for almost 100 years with only a few brief cessations within a parliamentary system, most commentators and the general public often refer to the Coalition as if it were a single party."," The Australian Electoral Commission has distinguished between \"traditional\" (Coalition/Labor) two-party-preferred (TPP/2PP) contests, and \"non-traditional\" (Independent, Greens, Liberal vs National) two-candidate-preferred (TCP/2CP) contests."," At the 2010 federal election, all eight seats which resulted in a two-candidate-preferred result were re-counted to also express a statistical-only \"traditional\" two-party-preferred result.","[5] A Coalition between the Liberal and National parties exists in New South Wales."," Led by Barry O'Farrell, it won the 2011 state election in a massive swing and the 2015 election with a reduced majority under Mike Baird."," The Coalition has existed in one form or another without interruption since 1927."," This remained the case even in 2011, when the Liberals won a majority in their own right but still retained the Coalition.","  The Nationals were the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition from 1925 until the Coalition was broken in 1983."," The Nationals then governed in their own right until 1989."," The Coalition was renewed in 1991, and won power under Rob Borbidge from 1996 to 1998."," In 2008, the parties agreed to merge, forming the Liberal National Party, under the leadership of former National Lawrence Springborg."," Springborg stood down in 2009, and was succeeded by former Liberal John-Paul Langbroek.","  The LNP won an overwhelming majority government in the 2012 state election under the leadership of former Liberal Campbell Newman, who had taken over from Langbroek a year earlier.","  However, it lost power in 2015, and Springborg returned to the leadership, only to lose a challenge by former Liberal Tim Nicholls in May 2016."," At the federal level, six LNP MPs sit with the Nationals and 16 with the Liberals.","[6]  In practice, most LNP MPs from Brisbane and the Gold Coast sit with the Liberals, while those from country seats usually sit with the Nationals."," The state branch of the Country Party merged with the Liberal Federation, the state branch of the UAP, in 1932 to form the Liberal and Country League."," A separate Country Party (later Nationals SA) was revived in 1963, though the main non-Labor party in South Australia continued to use the LCL name until 1973, when it became the state division of the Liberal Party.","  The party's current incarnation has only elected two representatives: Peter Blacker from 1973 to 1993, and Karlene Maywald from 1997 to 2010."," From 2004 to 2010, Maywald was a Minister in the Rann Labor Government, before losing her seat at the 2010 South Australian state election, thereby informally creating a Labor-National coalition in South Australia.","[7] The party did not run candidates at the 2010 federal election, but ran one candidate in the seat of Barker and two for the Senate at the 2013 election.","[8] The National Party has never done well in Tasmania, even though its first leader, William McWilliams, was a Tasmanian.","  A Tasmania branch of the then-Country Party was formed in 1922 and briefly held the balance of power, but merged with the Nationalists in 1924.","  It was refounded in 1962, but never gained much ground.","  In 1969, Liberal MHA Kevin Lyons, the son of former Prime Minister Lyons, pulled together most of the Tasmanian Country Party into the Centre Party, which held the balance of power in that year's state election.","  The Liberal-Centre alliance fell apart in 1972, forcing an early election.","  In 1975, what remained of the Centre Party became the Tasmanian chapter of what was by now the National Country Party before fading away completely.","  A Tasmanian National Party branch was briefly revived in the 1990s before it too disappeared, leaving the Liberal Party as the sole major non-Labor party in the state.","[9] A Coalition between the Liberal and National parties exists in Victoria."," The Liberal Party is led by Matthew Guy[10] and the National Party by Peter Walsh.","[11] The Country Party was the stronger coalition partner on multiple occasions from the 1920s through to the 1950s, and Country leaders served as Premier of Victoria on five separate occasions."," However, the relationship between the two parties was somewhat strained for most of the second half of the 20th century."," The presence of John McEwen, a Victorian, as number-two man in the federal government from 1958 to 1971 (including a brief stint as interim Prime Minister) did little to change this.","  The Liberals and Nationals fought elections separately from 1952 to 1989, but reached a Coalition agreement in 1990."," They fought and won the 1992 and 1996 elections as a Coalition under the leadership of Jeff Kennett."," When Peter Ryan became leader of the Nationals shortly after the Kennett government's 1999 election defeat, he terminated the Coalition agreement and led the Nationals into the 2002 and 2006 elections separately from the Liberals."," However, the Coalition agreement was renewed in 2008 and the Victorian Liberal and National parties went into the 2010 election as a Coalition."," The Coalition ended up winning the 2010 election with a one-seat margin under the leadership of Ted Baillieu, who resigned in 2013 and was succeeded by Denis Napthine.","  The Coalition lost power in 2014."," The Country Party was the stronger coalition partner from the 1933 state election to the 1947 state election, although the Coalition did not form government during this period."," The National Party was in Coalition with the state Liberal Party government from 1993 to 2001 (see Hendy Cowan), but the Coalition was subsequently broken."," In 2008, the Liberals under Colin Barnett, the Nationals under Brendon Grylls, and independent John Bowler formed a minority government after the 2008 election.",
